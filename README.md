# miniRT

A simple ray tracer built as part of the [42 School]([https://42.fr/en/homepage/](https://www.42adel.org.au/)) curriculum. `miniRT` renders 3D scenes using basic ray tracing techniques, handling spheres, planes, cylinders, lights, and camera perspective.

This project is written in C and uses the **minilibx** graphics library provided by 42.
